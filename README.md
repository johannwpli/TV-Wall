Origin
---
The TV Wall project was inspired by the [反送中直播台 No China Extradition Live](https://ncehk2019.github.io/) project<sup>[3]</sup>, which live-streamed Hong Kong in 2019. Wars never really end, and they are always happening somewhere or the other. In 2014, people in Taiwan fought against their government, while in 2020, it was the people of Thailand and Belarus. In 2021, the struggle for democracy continued in Myanmar and Iran, and in 2022, it was China's turn. Additionally, battles between countries such as Russia and Ukraine have continued for a long time. However, citizens of the earth who value democracy will always stand together and fight for freedom.
