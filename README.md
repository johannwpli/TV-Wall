Wars never end and are always nearby. Taiwanese fought against the government in 2014, while Thailand people and Belarusian in 2020, and Myanmar in 2021. Now 2022, Ukraine is being under attack by Russia. However, Earth citizens who pursue democracy will continue to stand together and fight for freedom!
